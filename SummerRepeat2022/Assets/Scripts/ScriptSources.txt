public static Vector3[] Steps;

public static void Position()
{
    Steps = new Vector3[someSize];

    Vector3 step = GameObject.Find("Step").transform.position;

    Steps[0] = step;

    Vector3 step1 = GameObject.Find("Step (1)").transform.position;
    Steps[1] = step1;
}

I used this stack overflow answer to apply it in my code so i could create an array of fixed positions where the keys can spawn
Then i added each position to the array so i can use random range to spawn a key in one of these positions.


    public Vector3[] spawnPoints;

public static void spawnPosition()
{
    Vector3[] spawnPoints = new Vector3[4];
    
    Vector3 spawnPos = new Vector3(12, -3f, 21.3f);
    Vector3 spawnPos1 = new Vector3(-10.6f, -3f, 19.16f);
    Vector3 spawnPos2 = new Vector3(15f, -3f, -.8f);
    Vector3 spawnPos3 = new Vector3(-4f, -3f, 25.5f);
    spawnPoints[0] = spawnPos;
    spawnPoints[1] = spawnPos1;
    spawnPoints[2] = spawnPos2;
    spawnPoints[3] = spawnPos3;
}
